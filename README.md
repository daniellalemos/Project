# Bioinformatics approaches for polyphenolic compounds production in _Escherichia coli_

This project aims to design an _E. coli_ strain able to produce polyphenolic compounds using a known heterologous pathway. The first step consists in the identification of the best candidate genes for the design of the polyphenolic pathway. Then, the _in silico_ modeling of the pathway and insertion into available metabolic model reconstructions of _E. coli_ will be performed. Finally, the mutant strain will be optimized through a rational design approach.
