# Bioinformatics approaches for polyphenolic compounds production in Escherichia coli
Prenylflavonoids and furanocoumarins, among the phenolic compounds have been regarded as appealing metabolites to produce due to their wide range of applications, particularly in medicine. These com- pounds are difficult and expensive to chemically synthesize and purify. For that reason, they are widely extracted from a variety of plants, de- spite their low concentration. Therefore, improving the production of these compounds is crucial. In this work, an Escherichia coli strain will be designed to produce these polyphenolic compounds using a known het- erologous pathway. For that, genome-scale E. coli models will be used to simulate in vivo behavior and optimize the mutant strain. Metabolic Phenotype Simulations and Evolutionary Algorithms will be able to ac- complish this.
