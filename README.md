# Bioinformatics approaches for polyphenolic compounds production in Escherichia coli

This project aims to design an E. coli strain able to produce polyphenolic com- pounds using a known heterologous pathway. The first step consists in the iden- tification of the best candidate genes for the design of the polyphenolic pathway. Then, the in silico modeling of the pathway and insertion into available metabolic model reconstructions of E. coli will be performed. Finally, the mutant strain will be optimized through a rational design approach.
